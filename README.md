> Static sites with superpowers

## Introduction

Staticman is a Node.js application that receives user-generated content and uploads it as data files to a GitHub repository. In practice, this allows you to have dynamic content (e.g. blog post comments) as part of a fully static website, as long as your site automatically deploys on every push to GitHub, as seen on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) and others.
